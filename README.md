just a very simple color flipper<br>
i think i could have customized it a little more for example adding a feature that would make the text color change<br>
if the background color is too dark but i think this does the trick well enough<br><br>
How long it took: maybe 30 minutes and that was because i had too figure out how to output a random color<br>
What i learned: the Math.random function and hexadecimal colors i guess
